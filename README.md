🚑 Healthcare Data Analysis Dashboard – AI-Powered Patient Insights 🧠📊
🧭 Overview
In this data-driven case study, I analyzed hospital admission records to uncover trends in patient demographics, medical conditions, billing amounts, and diagnostic test results. The project focuses on leveraging analytics and AI concepts to derive actionable healthcare insights and create impactful dashboards.

📌 Objectives
🔍 Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on hospital admission data

📊 Build interactive dashboards for visual storytelling

🧠 Provide personalized care recommendations based on patient profiles and billing trends

📊 Key Analysis Highlights
1️⃣ Billing Patterns by Admission Type
Emergency and urgent care cases incur significantly higher costs

Time-series plots showed billing spikes around critical admissions

2️⃣ High-Cost Medical Conditions
Identified top conditions with the highest billing impact:

🧬 Cancer

⚖️ Obesity

🍬 Diabetes

3️⃣ Patient Demographics Insight
Age and gender play a role in treatment frequency and billing amounts

Chronic conditions are demographically clustered, informing targeted care

4️⃣ AI Integration in Healthcare
Discussed how AI models can:

Predict patient risk levels
